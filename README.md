# Arduino Leonardo BadUSB

This project contains a BadUSB payload for the Arduino Leonardo that emulates a keyboard and sends pre-programmed keystrokes to a connected computer.
## Overview

The Arduino Leonardo acts as a USB HID device, automatically typing commands or executing scripts once plugged into a target machine. It can be used for automation, penetration testing, or demonstration purposes.
## Requirements

Arduino Leonardo (or any board with USB HID capabilities)

Arduino IDE ([download here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software))

USB cable to connect your Arduino

## Installation

Clone or download this repository.

Open the Arduino IDE and load the sketch.

Connect your Arduino Leonardo to your computer.

Select Arduino Leonardo as the board in the IDE.

Upload the sketch to the Arduino.

## Usage

Once connected, the Arduino will execute the programmed keystrokes on the host computer automatically.
